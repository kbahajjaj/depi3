    "##  Objective:\n",
    "You are provided with a real-world retail dataset. Your task is to **prepare the data for a machine learning classification model** that predicts whether a customer will purchase **more than 3 items in a single transaction**.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will perform a complete preprocessing pipeline from data exploration to handling imbalances, with visualizations and clear justifications for each step.\n",

    "Dataset link: [Customer Shopping Dataset – Retail Sales Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mehmettahiraslan/customer-shopping-dataset)\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains sales transactions from a retail environment with the following columns:\n",

    "##  Task Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "You must complete the following steps **in order**, and write clear explanations (in Markdown cells) alongside your code in a Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Load & Explore the Data\n",
    "- Load the dataset.\n",
    "- Display first few rows and general information.\n",
    "- Summary statistics of numerical and categorical features.\n",
    "- Visualizations:\n",
    "  - Histogram of `age`, `price`, and `quantity`.\n",
    "  - Countplot for `gender`, `category`, and `payment_method`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Clean the Data\n",
    "- Remove duplicate records if any.\n",
    "- Identify and remove/fix unrealistic values (e.g., negative or 0 prices, age outliers).\n",
    "- Provide a rationale for cleaning decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Handle Missing Data\n",
    "- Check for missing values.\n",
    "- Apply at least two different strategies to handle missing data:\n",
    "  - Drop\n",
    "  - Fill (e.g., with median, mode, etc.)\n",
    "- Justify why each method was chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Feature Engineering\n",
    "- Create a new column: `total_spent = quantity * price`\n",
    "- Create a new binary target column:\n",
    "  - 1 if `quantity > 3`, otherwise 0\n",
    "  - Name the new column `target`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Encode Categorical Variables\n",
    "- Encode all applicable categorical features using suitable encoding techniques.\n",
    "- Explain your choice (e.g., Label Encoding vs OneHot Encoding).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Detect & Handle Outliers\n",
    "- Use visualizations (e.g., boxplots) to detect outliers in numerical columns like `age`, `price`, and `total_spent`.\n",
    "- Apply IQR or another statistical method to handle outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Feature Scaling\n",
    "- Apply feature scaling to numerical columns like `age`, `price`, and `total_spent`.\n",
    "- Use either `StandardScaler` or `MinMaxScaler`.\n",
    "- Show distributions before and after scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Train-Test Split\n",
    "- Split the data into training and testing sets (80/20).\n",
    "- Use `stratify=y` to preserve class distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Deal with Imbalanced Classes\n",
    "- Check class distribution of your `target` variable.\n",
    "- If imbalanced, apply resampling techniques:\n",
    "  - Random UnderSampling or SMOTE\n",
    "- Show class distribution before and after resampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Deliverables:\n",
    "At the end of the session, you should submit:\n",
    "- A complete Jupyter Notebook with:\n",
    "  - Well-structured code\n",
    "  - Clear explanations using Markdown\n",
    "  - Visualizations embedded\n",
    "- A short reflection answering:\n",
    "  - What challenges did you face?\n",
    "  - What did you learn from this task?\n",
    "  - What would you do differently if the dataset was larger/messier?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hints:\n",
    "- Clean code is important! Keep your notebook readable.\n",
    "- Justify your preprocessing decisions.\n",
    "- Label your visualizations properly.\n",
